**Reproduction URL**

A public GitHub repo that includes a minimal reproduction of the bug. **Please do not link to your actual project**,
what we need instead is a _minimal_ reproduction in a fresh project without any unnecessary code. This means it doesn't
matter if your real project is private/confidential, since we want a link to a separate, isolated reproduction anyways.

A reproduction is **required** when filing a bug report — any bug report opened without a reproduction may be closed
and you'll be asked to create a new issue that includes a reproduction. We're a small team and we can't keep up with the
volume of issues we receive if we need to reproduce each issue from scratch ourselves.

**Describe your issue**

Describe the problem you're seeing, any important steps to reproduce and what behavior you expect instead.
